# scfa-replay-pause-eraser
Rust script to remove game pauses from Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance (SCFA) replays using https://gitlab.com/Askaholic/faf-replay-parser

## motivation
The author plays solo SCFA games using the (LOUD mod)[https://www.moddb.com/mods/loud-ai-supreme-commander-forged-alliance] with frequent pausing to evaluate the state of the game & queue up orders. During the viewing of replays the pause/unpause dialog will pop up frequently which is very annoying. This tool seeks to strip those pause/unpause events from the replay file.

## usage
